# Vercel Static Files Fix

## Problem

Your Django project was getting 404 errors for static files (favicon.ico and final.png) when deployed on Vercel.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`

- Added proper static file routing
- Added build command to collect static files
- Specified Python runtime

### 2. Created `vercel_build.py`

- Build script that runs during Vercel deployment
- Collects static files using `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Ensures static files are available in the `staticfiles` directory

### 3. Updated `vercel_app.py`

- Modified to run the build script when the app starts
- Ensures static files are collected if they don't exist

### 4. Created Custom Middleware (`portfolio/middleware.py`)

- `StaticFilesMiddleware` serves static files directly
- Falls back to serving files from `STATICFILES_DIRS` if not in `STATIC_ROOT`
- Provides a safety net for static file serving

### 5. Updated Django Settings

- Added the custom middleware to `MIDDLEWARE` list
- Ensured proper static file configuration

## Files Modified

- `vercel.json` - Updated routing and build configuration
- `vercel_app.py` - Added static file collection
- `vercel_build.py` - New build script
- `portfolio/middleware.py` - New custom middleware
- `myportfolio/settings.py` - Added middleware and improved static file config

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to your main branch
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new configuration
4. The build script will collect static files during deployment
5. Static files should now be served correctly

## Testing

After deployment, check:

- Favicon loads correctly in browser tab
- `final.png` image displays in navbar and footer
- No 404 errors in browser console for static files

## Troubleshooting

If static files still don't load:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for any build errors
2. Verify that `staticfiles` directory is created during build
3. Ensure all static files are committed to your repository
4. Check that file paths in templates are correct
